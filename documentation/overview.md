## Problems & Solutions

<details>

<summary>Problems</summary>

We noticed some things at our university that could be better. For example, students often struggle with confusing processes and don't always have the right support to do well in their studies.

We're trying to make different options to help our friends at university by finding new ways to make learning easier.

<summary>Solutions</summary>

Our Portal offers different helpful services.

One thing it does is give students regular updates about their professors and classes.

Another thing our Portal does is analyze students' grades to see how they're doing. It looks at their grades over time and shows them where they're doing well and where they might need to work harder.

This helps students understand how they're doing in their classes and how they can improve their GPA.

## Audience or target users for the documentation

Students within the Business Information Systems department at Helwan University in Cairo, Egypt, are the primary audience for our solution.\
\
Given their academic focus on business information systems, target users within this department are likely to be analytical, detail-oriented, and proactive in seeking solutions to challenges they encounter in their studies.
